# 🧑‍💻 Development & design notes

Developer-facing docs for **KHost Cue** — how to build and test it, and the reasoning behind a few non-obvious parts. For the product overview, features, and screenshots, see **[README.md](README.md)**. For AI-agent / contributor coding conventions (style, patterns, gotchas), see **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)**.

## 🛠️ Tech stack

- **[.NET 10](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)** with **[.NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/)** — native iOS/Android shell hosting a Razor (Blazor) UI.
- On-device storage in JSON files behind interfaces (`ISongListStore`, `ITonightStore`, `IVenueStore`, `ISingerStore`, `ILyricsCache`) that keep storage concerns out of the UI. The song-list and tonight stores are namespaced per singer, so each person's lists live in their own file.

## 🚀 Building from source

### Prerequisites

- **.NET 10 SDK** with the MAUI workload:
  ```bash
  dotnet workload install maui
  ```
- **Android**: the Android SDK, a JDK 17+, and an emulator or a connected device. If you have neither SDK nor JDK, .NET Android can fetch both at the versions this project targets:
  ```bash
  dotnet build KHost.Mobile/KHost.Mobile.csproj -f net10.0-android -t:InstallAndroidDependencies \
    -p:AndroidSdkDirectory=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk -p:JavaSdkDirectory=$HOME/Library/Android/jdk \
    -p:AcceptAndroidSDKLicenses=true
  ```
  Then export `ANDROID_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME` at those paths so plain `dotnet build` finds them — otherwise every build needs the `-p:AndroidSdkDirectory=… -p:JavaSdkDirectory=…` flags. (The warnings that target logs on its *first* run are from the evaluation pass before the SDK exists; they clear once it's installed.)
- **iOS**: a paired Mac (iOS cannot be built on Windows).
- **macOS (Mac Catalyst)**: full **Xcode** — Command Line Tools alone is not enough. Point the toolchain at it with `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`.

> Restore walks **every** target framework the project declares, even when you build a single head with `-f`, so a build fails until all of them have workloads. `dotnet workload restore KHost.Mobile/KHost.Mobile.csproj` installs exactly the set this project needs.

### Build & run

```bash
# Android
dotnet build KHost.Mobile/KHost.Mobile.csproj -f net10.0-android "-p:BaseOutputPath=./obj/_build"

# Deploy and launch on a connected Android device / emulator
dotnet build KHost.Mobile/KHost.Mobile.csproj -t:Run -f net10.0-android "-p:BaseOutputPath=./obj/_build"

# Run on Windows — the quickest way to iterate on the Blazor UI (no emulator needed)
dotnet run --project KHost.Mobile -f net10.0-windows10.0.19041.0 "-p:BaseOutputPath=./obj/_build"

# Run on macOS — the Mac equivalent, same story (no simulator needed)
dotnet run --project KHost.Mobile -f net10.0-maccatalyst "-p:BaseOutputPath=./obj/_build"
```

> `-p:BaseOutputPath=./obj/_build` keeps build output out of the IDE's `bin/` folder so it doesn't get locked while the IDE is open.

### Backing up on-device data (before a risky redeploy)

Deploying with `-t:Run` **updates the app in place** — the on-device data (`files/*.json`, `shared_prefs/`) survives. It's only wiped by an **uninstall**, and the sneaky way that happens is a *reinstall you didn't ask for*: deploying a build signed with a **different debug keystore** (fresh machine, regenerated `~/.android/debug.keystore`) fails to install over the existing app with a signature mismatch, and the tooling falls back to uninstall + reinstall — taking your singers, song lists, tonight sets, venues and settings with it. A manual "uninstall to fix a launch crash" does the same.

The host test suites (Unit + Integration) run against a throwaway temp folder and **never touch device data** — so the risk is device deploys, not tests. **Back up before any redeploy that might reinstall, or before any manual uninstall:**

```bash
dotnet run scripts/backup-device-data.cs -- backup                 # timestamped .tar.gz -> device-backups/ (gitignored)
dotnet run scripts/backup-device-data.cs -- list                   # what backups exist
dotnet run scripts/backup-device-data.cs -- inspect <file.tar.gz>  # peek inside one
dotnet run scripts/backup-device-data.cs -- restore <file.tar.gz>  # push a backup back onto the device
#   -s, --serial <serial>   target one of several attached devices (also honors $ANDROID_SERIAL)
#   restore also takes -y/--yes to skip the confirmation
```

The script is a **[.NET 10 file-based app](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/program-structure/top-level-statements)** (`scripts/*.cs` run with `dotnet run`) — our convention for repo scripts, so they run identically on Windows, Linux, and macOS with no extra dependency beyond the .NET SDK everyone already has. (On Unix you can also `chmod +x scripts/backup-device-data.cs` and run it directly via its shebang.) It uses `adb run-as khost.mobile` (works only on the **Debug**, debuggable build — no root needed) to stream a tar of the app's private data dir off the device, gzipped in-process (no host `tar`/`gzip` needed). Backups land in `device-backups/`, gitignored so real singer data never reaches GitHub. `restore` force-stops the app, then extracts the tarball back in place; relaunch to see the restored data.

> **Wireless adb tip:** the wireless-debugging **port rotates each session** — read it live from Settings → Developer options → Wireless debugging. If `adb connect` wedges after a failed attempt, `adb kill-server && adb start-server` clears it.

### Sample data for testing

Need songs to populate the list while testing? This public **YouTube Music** playlist imports cleanly via **Import & Export → YouTube Music**:

```

## 🧪 Testing

Two xUnit projects, split by what they touch. Both must pass before any commit:

```bash
# Unit tests — pure, no-I/O logic (playlist/metadata/lyrics parsers, Genres.Map, SongListItem computed properties)
dotnet test KHost.Mobile.UnitTests/KHost.Mobile.UnitTests.csproj "-p:BaseOutputPath=./obj/_build"

# Integration tests — the JSON stores against a real temp folder (real file I/O + serialization)
dotnet test KHost.Mobile.IntegrationTests/KHost.Mobile.IntegrationTests.csproj "-p:BaseOutputPath=./obj/_build"
```

Neither test project needs the MAUI workload: they target plain `net10.0`. The MAUI-free source they cover (models, stores) is pulled in via linked `<Compile>` since a `net10.0` project can't reference the MAUI head. The stores' only device dependency — the app-data folder — is abstracted behind `IAppDataDirectory`, which the integration tests point at a throwaway temp directory.

## 📸 Screenshots

**Screenshot / mobile-preview target size:** **786 × 1704 px** — a **393 × 852** (iPhone 15/16) viewport at **2× device-pixel-ratio**. Capture screenshots and size the mobile preview to this so everything lines up with the screenshot grid.

## 🎨 Design notes

**Album art — why `blob:` URLs and not `<img src>` / `file://`.** Covers are cached as plain image files in the app's private data directory (`Data/album-art/`, named by a hash of the source URL). But the Blazor WebView serves only the bundled, read-only `wwwroot`, and its page origin is `https://0.0.0.1` — so it has **no route to a file in the data directory**: `file://` access to the app-private dir is sandbox-blocked, an `https` page loading a `file://` resource is a cross-origin/mixed-content violation, and `wwwroot` can't be written to at runtime.

Referencing the cached file directly would therefore need a **per-platform serving handler** — WebView2 `SetVirtualHostNameToFolderMapping`, Android `WebViewAssetLoader` / `shouldInterceptRequest`, iOS `WKURLSchemeHandler` — three separate native implementations, the riskiest of which (Android) can't be verified without an on-device run.

Instead, the cover bytes are streamed to the WebView via a `DotNetStreamReference` and turned into a `blob:` object URL in `wwwroot/js/album-art.js` — **one implementation that behaves identically on every platform**, so it's verifiable once. The card's CSS background then holds a short `blob:` URL rather than a base64 `data:` copy of every image, and art is loaded only for the currently-paged cards, so image memory stays bounded by what's on screen. `js/album-art.js` owns the object-URL lifecycle (revoked when a cover is replaced, on a singer switch, and on page teardown). The platform-serving approach remains a valid alternative if the C#↔JS transfer ever becomes a bottleneck.

**Crash-safe store writes.** Every JSON store writes to a same-directory `.tmp` file and atomically renames it over the target (`AtomicFile.WriteAsync`) — a same-volume rename, so a write interrupted by an app kill or power loss leaves the *last good* file intact instead of a truncated one. (The load path treats a corrupt file as "start empty", which for a direct overwrite would silently lose the whole list.) A file that fails to parse on load is moved aside to a `.corrupt` sibling rather than being overwritten by the next save, so the bad bytes are preserved for recovery.

**Split button — one control, a default action plus a menu.** `SplitButton` / `SplitButtonItem` (`Components/`) render a primary action segment beside a chevron that drops a menu of related actions — e.g. *Mark sung* with alternate ways to log it, or *Find on YouTube* with Spotify / KaraFun / Lyrics behind the chevron to reclaim sheet height. Reusable: pass the default via `OnPrimary` and the extras as `SplitButtonItem` children (each takes `Icon` / `Description` / `Separated`), with `Direction` (Down/Up, for buttons low in a sheet), `Align`, and `Variant` (Primary/Tonal/Secondary) knobs. Dismissal reuses the header ⋮ menu's approach — a transparent full-screen scrim for an outside tap, plus `IBackButtonService` so the Android back button closes the menu instead of navigating — so there's **no bespoke JS**; it's styled with the shared `.btn` variants and `--kh-` tokens.

**Mac Catalyst head — a layout preview, not a product.** There is no desktop KHost Cue and none is planned. The Catalyst head exists for the same reason as the Windows head: iterating on the Blazor UI without waiting on an emulator. Everything about it is tuned for that and nothing for shipping — it builds `maccatalyst-arm64` only (native on Apple silicon, one slice instead of two), and `App.CreateWindow` opens it at exactly the **393 × 852** mobile-preview viewport documented under Screenshots, so what you see matches the screenshot grid. It stays resizable so you can drag it wider to find where a layout breaks.

**Getting Catalyst to actually honor that viewport** took more than setting `Window.Width`/`Height`, and the reasons are all Catalyst-isms worth knowing before touching `App.PinToMobilePreviewViewport`:

- **Size without position is a silent no-op.** MAUI's `WindowExtensions.UpdateCoordinates` issues the macOS geometry request only when `X`, `Y`, `Width` *and* `Height` are all non-`NaN`. Set just the size and nothing happens at all — the window opens at Catalyst's 1024 × 768 default, i.e. a desktop-wide layout, which is the one thing this head is not for.
- **Even with a position, the geometry request is clamped to the screen's visible frame.** The Dock alone is enough to hand back a window shorter than requested, so the viewport silently stops matching the grid. The scene's **size restrictions** (`Window.MinimumHeight`/`MaximumHeight`) are *not* clamped, so pinning min = max is the only way to land an exact size. The pin is released half a second later so the window is still draggable — releasing it in the same pass just leaves the window at its old size, because the pin is what drives the resize.
- **The size applies to the window frame, and macOS claims part of it back** as a safe-area inset for the title bar, leaving the web view a title bar short of the viewport. The inset reads `0` until the first layout pass settles, so it's measured rather than hard-coded (a hard-coded title-bar height would rot across macOS versions): the page *is* the web view area, so whatever its height comes up short is exactly what the window has to grow by. Net result on macOS 15: an 884 pt window for an 852 pt viewport.
- **`UIDeviceFamily` includes `6` (Mac idiom, "Optimize Interface for Mac").** Without it Catalyst runs scaled-iPad mode and draws everything at **77%**, so the 393 × 852 viewport occupies 303 × 657 macOS points and a 2× screen capture comes out 606 × 1314 — off the 786 × 1704 screenshot grid, with every layout measurement off by the same 1.3×. Nothing in the app branches on `DeviceInfo.Idiom`, so the Mac idiom only changes scaling.

To capture a screenshot from this head, grab the window (`screencapture -l <windowid>`) and crop the title bar off the top — the remainder is exactly 786 × 1704.

Treat a wide Catalyst window as a diagnostic, not a bug: the shell is deliberately mobile-first (fixed bottom tab bar, full-bleed cards, swipe and press-and-hold gestures), so stretching it *should* look wrong. Don't add desktop breakpoints to `wwwroot/app.css` to "fix" it.

It cost almost nothing to add because the platform-specific code was already conditioned on `ANDROID || IOS`, and Catalyst defines `MACCATALYST` rather than `IOS`: the ML Kit / Apple Vision QR scanner is scoped out of the package reference and falls through to `UnsupportedQrScanner`, and `MauiHaptics` already swallows `FeatureNotSupportedException`. Two things did need adding — `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` in the Catalyst `Info.plist` (Apple *aborts the process* rather than throwing when location is requested without it, so its absence would crash rather than degrade) and `com.apple.security.personal-information.location` in `Entitlements.plist`, since App Sandbox otherwise denies Core Location outright. Both are needed to exercise the venue auto-select while testing, not for distribution.

Mouse input covers the gestures: `swipe.js` runs off pointer events, so click-and-drag is a swipe and click-and-hold is a press-and-hold. Where a gesture is awkward to trigger, the reachable equivalents added for assistive tech work too — Venues' *Active* toggle and the singer sheet's *Switch to this singer*.
